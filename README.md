# AI-Generated vs Human-Written Essay Detection 🤖📝

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on distinguishing AI-generated essays from human-written text using classical machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

With the rapid adoption of large language models, AI-generated text increasingly resembles human writing. This project addresses the challenge of reliably detecting whether an essay is written by a human or generated by AI.

The system classifies essays into:
- **0** → Human-written  
- **1** → AI-generated  

---

## 🔬 Dataset

- ~500,000 essays (human-written + AI-generated)
- Each sample contains:
  - Raw essay text
  - Binary label
- Data split into training, development, and test sets
- Class imbalance handled using weighted evaluation metrics

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Text length and sentence statistics  
- Lexical diversity (Type-Token Ratio)  
- Readability scores (Flesch Reading Ease, ARI)  
- Stop-word and punctuation ratios  
- TF-IDF representations for classical models  

---

## 🛠️ Models Used

### 🧪 Baselines
- Majority Class Predictor  
- Linear SVM with TF-IDF features  

### 🧠 Deep Learning
- Bidirectional LSTM for sequential modeling  
- Fine-tuned **BERT (bert-base-uncased)** for contextual understanding  

---

## 📊 Results

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score |
|------|----------|----------|
| Majority Baseline | ~62% | ~48% |
| SVM + TF-IDF | ~90% | ~89% |
| Bi-LSTM | ~98% | ~97% |
| BERT 🔥 | ~99.9% | ~99.8% |

✅ Context-aware models significantly outperform classical approaches.
