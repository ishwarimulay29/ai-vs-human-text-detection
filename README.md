# AI-Generated vs Human-Written Essay Detection 🤖📝

A Natural Language Processing (NLP) project focused on distinguishing AI-generated essays from human-written text using classical machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models.

---

## 🧠 Project Overview

With the rapid adoption of large language models, AI-generated text increasingly resembles human writing, making reliable detection a challenging task. This project addresses the problem of automatically identifying whether an essay is written by a human or generated by AI.

The task is framed as a **binary classification problem**:
- **0** → Human-written  
- **1** → AI-generated  

The project follows a progressive modeling approach, starting from a strong classical baseline and extending to deep learning and transformer-based architectures.

## 🔬 Dataset

- ~500,000 essays consisting of both human-written and AI-generated text  
- Each sample contains:
  - Raw essay text
  - Binary label  
- Data split into training, development, and test sets  
- Class imbalance handled using **weighted precision, recall, and F1-score**

---

## 🧹 Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

Key preprocessing and feature engineering steps include:
- Text length and sentence-level statistics  
- Lexical diversity (Type-Token Ratio)  
- Readability metrics (Flesch Reading Ease, Automated Readability Index)  
- Stop-word and punctuation ratios  
- TF-IDF vectorization for classical models  

These features capture stylistic and structural differences between human and AI-generated text.

## 🛠️ Models Used

### 🧪 Strong Baseline
- **Linear SVM with TF-IDF features**
- Serves as a high-performing classical NLP baseline

### 🧠 Extension 1: Bi-directional LSTM
- Sequence-based neural model trained on raw text
- Captures long-range dependencies and contextual patterns
- Implemented as an extension over the strong baseline

### 🤖 Extension 2: Fine-Tuned BERT
- Transformer-based classifier using **bert-base-uncased**
- Fine-tuned end-to-end for AI vs human text detection
- Captures subtle linguistic and contextual cues beyond surface features
