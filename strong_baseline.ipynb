Students Fine to goof off in them summer and could care very Little about school. If students did their own projects some of them might be a good project while others students projects Books Fine they didn't try at AFF. Teachers should come up with summer projects because it is more organized for the students to do, easier for the teacher to grade, and it motivates every student to try and put in effort in their projects.\\n\\nTeachers should assign summer projects because it would be more organized. Many students that I know hardly put in any work writing their own essays in school even when they can write about whatever they want to. Some students don't know how to write an essay or how to even come up with the structure of one so how do people expect students to come up with their own personal summer project. Some students, however, are very creative in coming up with certain project ideas and are able to create or finish an essay easily. Not AFF students are Fine this. A For\\u00a0of students need to be told what to do for a project because they aren't that creative in coming up with ideas for projects and need help.\\n\\nAssigning summer projects by teachers make it easier for them to grade the project. Teachers usually have a hard time grading essays already even when they assign a certain book that the students are supposed to read. It makes their job twice as harder if the students were allowed to make their own project because its AFF different topics rather than 1 topic. Some teachers are ready good though at grading peoples assignments and know some facts students projects. Most teachers, however, are not Fine this at AFF, and they find it easier for them to just assign one topic for the student to make a project about so that it is easier to grade.\\n\\nStudents Back motivation in doing schoolwork, especially projects. Some students that I have meet could care Fess about projects even if they have the choice to come up with their own ideas. They see projects as a pointless thing because they are already doing bad at school and the feet Fine it's not gonna help their grade so what's the point. Some students are more motivated in trying to get their grades up and if they were able to make their own projects they would feet more motivated to get better grades. However, not AFF students think the same way and would rather feet more motivated if teachers handed out the topics for projects rather than make their own project.\\n\\nSummer projects should be assigned by teachers rather than students make their own summer project. It makes everything easier for both the student and the teacher. It also allow students to easily research the topic so that they can enjoy their summer rather than worry about it AFF summer. Some students would also procrastinate it and wait tiff the end if they were to make their own summer projects and it wouldn't be as good of a project as if the teacher were to assign the project.\",\n          \"Title: A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\\n\\nOnce upon a time, there lived a cowboy named Buck, who loved the wild open spaces of the American West and the freedom they offered. He spent most of his days on the vast plains of Texas, riding his horse and herding cattle with the other cowboys. But Buck had a secret passion that he kept hidden from his peers \\u2013 he was also an avid surfer.\\nBuck grew up near the coast of California, where his family spent their vacations surfing. As Buck grew older, his love for surfing only increased, and he began to dream of the perfect wave. He would watch the surfers at the local beaches with admiration, longing to feel the thrill of riding the powerful ocean waves.\\nOne day, Buck decided to make his dream a reality. He packed his surfboard and set off on a journey to the west coast. He traveled through the desert and over the mountains, finally arriving at a beautiful beach in California. Buck was overjoyed when he saw the rolling waves crashing onto the shore.\\nBuck quickly changed into his swimsuit, grabbed his surfboard, and ran into the ocean. He was amazed at how different the ocean felt compared to the rivers and creeks he was used to back home. The water was colder, and the waves were more powerful and unpredictable.\\nDespite the challenges, Buck persevered. He spent days practicing and learning from other experienced surfers. Soon, he was able to ride the waves with confidence and skill. Buck was finally living his dream of being a cowboy who rode the waves.\\nBuck's secret passion for surfing made him a legend among his peers. They were fascinated by his ability to switch from the rough life of a cowboy to the graceful movements of a surfer. Buck became known as the \\\"Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\\\" and inspired many young cowboys to explore their hidden talents and passions.\\nIn the end, Buck continued to live his life split between the American West and the west coast, where he could pursue his love for both cattle herding and surfing. The Cowboy Who Rode the Waves became an inspiration to others who dared to challenge their own boundaries, and his legacy lives on in the hearts of those who heard his story.\",\n          \"As an average 8thgrade student, I have developed a talent for playing the guitar. I have been playing the guitar for about 5 years now, and it has become a passion for me. I have always been fascinated by music, and the guitar has allowed me to express my love for it in a creative way.\\n\\nFurthermore, I first learned how to play the guitar from my older brother, who had been playing for a few years at the time. He taught me the basics, such as how to hold the guitar, how to read sheet music, and how to play some simple chords. From there, I began to experiment with different songs and styles of music, and I quickly became hooked.\\n\\nOver the years, my talent for playing the guitar has developed significantly. I have practiced regularly, and I have taken lessons from a professional guitar teacher to help me improve my technique and learn new songs. I have also been influenced by other guitarists, both famous and local, and have tried to emulate their styles and techniques.\\n\\nOne of my biggest influences has been the legendary guitarist Jimi Hendrix. I have always been damaged by his skill and creativity, and I have spent countless hours listening to his music and trying to learn his songs. I have also been influenced by other famous guitarists such as Eric Clapton, Jimmy Page, and Slash.\\n\\nIn addition to these famous guitarists, I have also been influenced by local musicians in my community. I have attended local music festivals and concerts, and I have been inspired by the talent and creativity of the local musicians I have seen perform. I have also been fortunate enough to have some talented friends who also play the guitar, and I have learned a lot from them as well.\\n\\nIn conclusion, my talent for playing the guitar has developed significantly over the years, and I have been influenced by a variety of musicians, both famous and local. I have been fortunate enough to have a supportive family and community that has encouraged me to pursue my passion for music. I am excited to continue to learn and grow as a musician, and I am grateful for the opportunity to share my love for music with others.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n

So shouldn't voting be the same way? That's why America should have popularity voting because electoral voting is unconstitutional, it doesn't give little states a say so, and it's plain unfair.\\n\\nFirst, Popularity voting should be the way we vote because it's constitutional. Abraham Lincoln one stated that \\\"this is a nation for the people, by the people, and from the people\\\"; its part of the constitution. Also, this is one nation under god and the almighty father believes in fairness; wouldn't you agree the people deserve a say so? Popularity voting allows the people to show what they support instead of electoral not serving the people Justice. Electoral voting allows segregation because some states don't get a say so, but the question is aren't we one nation? The constitution says all men are equal;so what makes a man in California better than a man in North Carolina? So that's one strike for electoral voting.\\n\\nFurthermore, popularity voting gives little states a say so. Did you know that small states like Rhode Island, South Carolina, and other 15 states sometimes don't get to see candidates? It's unfair that electoral voting only aims for states with high electoral voting. Popularity voting will change that giving little states a say so will heighten the ratio and maybe change the outcome. Popularity voting allows small states to put their opinion in on whom they want as president because they are part of the country as well. Electoral treats small states like they don't matter, and it's time to change that; Electoral voting now has two strikes.\\n\\nFinally, popularity voting is just fair. Everyone born in America was born into the land of the free, land of the equal, land of the brave, so why shouldn't voting be like that? Everyone deserves the right to pick who they want to represent them, and if not it's abusing their rights. Popularity voting is the were while because electoral voting is unfair, they ob strain your rights and your freedom of speech; you deserve to say who you want in office. They rather put you on mute and say you don't matter; we have to stand up. Electoral voting that was your last straw.\\n\\nIn conclusion, America should have popularity voting because electoral voting is unconstitutional, it doesn't give little states a say so, and it's plain unfair. Also, popularity voting is now the most popular voting style. We as Americans are tired of being treated unfairly, and we are sticking to our national slogan; three strikes your out so goodbye electoral voting.\",\n          \"Dear TEACHER_NAME,\\n\\nI think community service is a very important requirement to have in schools. We all live in a community, so we all need to work as a community.\\n\\nWhere would we be ii people didn't help each other out? II we didn't take the time to do something IOR the surrounding ones? No where. We would all still be living in caves! Community service has helped us all at some point. Even ii it doesn't have to-do directly with ourselves, like cleaning the trash out IOR parks or giving clothes and other necessities to Goodwill or The Salvation Army.\\n\\nLending a hand in some way would teach kids life lessons we would carry with us IOR the rest oi our lives. Spending time in the community just an New times a month would teach hard work, how to work well with others, and how in order to be able to take you have to give back. Also, how to accept differences, because everyone you meet won't be the same as you are, or think the same as you might.\\n\\nI understand many students are not open to this idea or don't want to work outside oi school. Extra credit could be offered as a way to help motivate students. An extra point could very hour spend working in the community. High school credits could be given. Maybe you could choose how much time a month you would spend doing community service. There could be a group service project, so you could work with Friends to make it seem like In!\\n\\nCommunity service is necessary in our world to be able to perform and have the things that we do. It teaches life lessons that might help in a job search later in life. That is why in my opinion there should be a community service requirement at our school.\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nSTUDENT_NAME \",\n          \"\\\"Carefree\\\" Many rivers around the world are retiring to take a break from driving ANR have now reciter to \\\"think green.\\\" Although some may disagree that this could be helpful toward the environment there is evidence that says it is helpful. Some may not see the point ANR think that this new epidemic is inconvenient, but maybe they just are not educated about these new areas.\\n\\nThroughout the globe multiple cities have found ways to use some forms of public transportation, firing bicycles, ANR even walking to get themselves where they near to go. For example, Bogot\\u00e1, Colombia has a \\\"carefree\\\" ray every year when only public transportation is available. Like Enrique Rivera sear in paragraph 26 the people of this city in Colombia are a part of this great change that encourages others to join in. The author also states in paragraph 28 that there are new parks ANR sidewalks which would have a positive effect on the attractiveness of their city.\\n\\nImagine having a \\\"carefree\\\" ray everyday of the year. That is exactly what a new city in German has one. Vauban, German was built in 2006 as a suburb with no real streets or parking spaces. Citizen of this new city only have two places to park their cars, in a large garage outside of town with a space costing 40,000 or in their home. As sear in paragraph 3 most of the families in Vauban RO not own a car ANR more than half sold their cars to move into the \\\"carefree\\\" city. Most of the citizens feel less stressed ANR more relaxer about no longer having a car also.\\n\\nSurely you're thinking \\\"What about the U.S.? They're one of the most powerful countries in the world they must have some insight on this new trend.\\\" As a matter of fact they RO. The U.S. has slowly starter to take a break from the automobile. More ANR more of the new generations have reciter to not get their river's licenses. In most big cities in the U.S. such as New York most of their citizens RO not own a car ANR rather just walk or use other transportation rue to traffic. It can be easier just to walk somewhere rather than to sit in a car that's basically parker rue to such bar traffic. In other parts of the U.S., there is a new trend of carpooling which can not only have a positive impact on the environment but can also save you money. In paragraph 43, even Bill For, executive chairman of the For Motor Company, agrees that less use of a car can have a positive impact.\\n\\nOverall, the reduction of private vehicle transportation can help reduce the negative affects on the environment ANR on other aspects of life such as stress level. Multiple countries have starter to join in this new worldwide area of how to make this world a better environment for the future ANR most all of them have contributed having others try it out. If we all are willing to give up a little for one thing it can make a big difference for everyone in the world's future.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"actual_generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"predicted_generated\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"is_correct\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"boolean\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          true\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{}}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"d79b79c0","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765812987912,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Nhat-Ha Pham","userId":"12058100056388403362"}},"outputId":"cdeeed23-01a8-4ec7-bc64-cea6f6505642"},"source":["from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","\n","print(\"Confusion Matrix (Test Set):\")\n","print(confusion_matrix(y_test, y_test_pred))"],"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Confusion Matrix (Test Set):\n","[[28657  1847]\n"," [ 3074 15146]]\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"id":"f_IjkIFfYN_1","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1765812987915,"user_tz":-420,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Nhat-Ha Pham","userId":"12058100056388403362"}},"outputId":"bb11a69c-7dfb-45ce-acfe-b5cc7d42e815"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Test accuracy: 0.8990025449470487\n"]}],"source":["print(\"Test accuracy:\", accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred))"]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[],"gpuType":"T4"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python"},"accelerator":"GPU"},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
